# Upstream Ceph defects

This registry records the defects in upstream ceph/ceph that rgw-go runs
into: in radosgw, the RGW object classes, librados, librbd, or the OSD
behaviour they rely on. rgw-go must coexist with radosgw on the same pools,
so a defect in radosgw's behaviour is part of the compatibility contract
(section 8 of the design spec). The registry says, per defect:
- which releases carry it;
- whether rgw-go reproduces it, works around it, or is unaffected;
- where it stands upstream.

Each entry names its kind:

- **Defect** means upstream code does the wrong thing, whether or not
  upstream has fixed it in a later release.
- **Quirk** means the behaviour is intended upstream but surprises a
  reimplementation, for example a round trip that is not byte-identical.

Each entry records its evidence at a named release tag, and how it was found.
Every claim is verified against the source or a cluster, not taken from a
report. Add an entry whenever a task, review or benchmark hits an upstream
defect or quirk. Update it when upstream fixes it or rgw-go's handling
changes. go-ceph's defects live in `docs/cgo-limitations.md`, not here.

## Squid does not guard listing-time index suggestions against resharding

- **Kind:** defect, fixed in Tentacle.
- **Evidence:**
  - Listing sends `cls_rgw_suggest_changes` to repair stale index entries, and
    at v19.2.6 it sends them without the reshard guard (`rgw_rados.cc:9902`
    and `:10138`).
  - Ceph commit 461be1cd3d5, "rgw/rados: guard against dir suggest during
    reshard", adds the guard: "no changes to the bucket index should be
    allowed while resharding". It is in v20.0.0 and later (v20.2.4
    `rgw_rados.cc:10823` and `:11061`).
  - It is not on the squid branch as of a742f50 (2026-09-03).
- **Releases:** Squid, every release through v19.2.6.
- **rgw-go:** follows the cluster's release. Its Tentacle-level listing guards
  its suggestions; its Squid-level listing matches radosgw and does not.
  `docs/exclusions.md` states the guard per release.
- **Found:** final phase 0 review, 2026-09-26.

## The 2pc queue's reserved size drifts upward

- **Kind:** defect, fixed.
- **Evidence:**
  - `cls_2pc_queue` reserve adds size+10 per entry, but commit, abort and
    expire subtract only size, so `reserved_size` grows until reservations
    fail with ENOSPC.
  - The fix is Ceph commits b97fe168f62 and 8f86e0926f4, first released in
    v19.2.4 and v20.2.3.
  - Even after the fix, only a reservation recomputes `reserved_size`, and
    only for a queue head decoded at struct version 2 or lower. Heads are
    re-encoded at version 3, so drift accrued before an upgrade persists.
- **Releases:** v19.2.3 and earlier, v20.2.2 and earlier. The residual drift
  outlives the upgrade.
- **rgw-go:** never assumes `reserved_size` is exact. `docs/exclusions.md`
  records the accounting per release.
- **Found:** reported by rgw-rs; verified against the tags in the phase 0
  final review.

## radosgw adds STANDARD to an empty placement target on decode

- **Kind:** quirk.
- **Evidence:** at v19.2.6 the binary decoder of a zonegroup placement target
  inserts `STANDARD` when `storage_classes` is empty (`rgw_zone_types.h:624`),
  and the JSON decoder does the same (`rgw_zone.cc:757`). So a zonegroup that
  radosgw decodes and re-encodes is longer than the stored bytes: 448 bytes
  against 436 on the phase 0 cluster. ceph-dencoder round-trips the stored
  bytes unchanged.
- **Releases:** Squid and Tentacle.
- **rgw-go:** encodes what is stored, matching ceph-dencoder. The phase 0
  gate keeps a ceph-dencoder oracle for a zonegroup that hits this case; since
  populate added a cloud-tier storage class, the phase 0 clusters no longer
  do.
- **Found:** phase 0 gate, Task 15.

## librbd leaks the update-watch context when registration fails

- **Kind:** defect, currently unreachable.
- **Evidence:** at v19.2.6 `rbd_update_watch` allocates a `C_UpdateWatchCB`
  and returns it as the handle whatever `register_update_watcher` returns
  (`librbd.cc:6887-6897`). Only `rbd_update_unwatch` frees it, so a failed
  registration would leak it. `register_update_watcher` returns 0 on every
  path from v19.2.3 through v20.3.0, so the failure cannot happen today.
- **Releases:** every release checked, v19.2.3 through v20.3.0.
- **rgw-go:** unaffected; it does not use rbd. go-ceph's side of the same
  path is ceph/go-ceph#1342.
- **Found:** go-ceph upstreaming audit, 2026-09-27.
